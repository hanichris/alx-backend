# Internationalization and Localization
## Description
This is often abbreviated as I18n and L10n. It is a way to make an application friendly to non-English speakers through provision of a translation workflow, with the help of language translators. The application can now be offered to users in a choice of languages.
The ``flask`` extension ``Flask-Babel`` makes it easy to work with translations.
